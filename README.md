# Welcome to the Project "REDKK" (tentatively RelativityRadio)!

Hi! Welcome! This is the repository for Boston University CS411 Group 5. And our team's name is REDKK!

> How did this name come about?
> R,E,D,K,K is the prefix of the discord usernames of all five team members. We just combined them together.

Here is a full list of our diligent contributors to the team. We put their role names here, but surely they're always rolling up and exploring opportunity areas in our project to make cross-functional improvements.

 - **Hengyuan Liu**
 - **Chave,Reid,B**

# What is our project doing?

**We have deployed our final project deliverable on the AWS!:**

# What techical designs are made in our project?

This proto-prototype plays with Angular on Node.js, becuase that seemed like somewhere to start.

# What should be expected next?

We're going to make this thing do something cool!

# Thank-you List

Thank you to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

# Quick start:

**In order to work on the files in the /app/relativity-radio you will need to install Node.js as well as npm (all of which can be done from the command line).** ([I basically followed this guide.](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local))

The contents of the relativity-radio directory are currently a development workspace containing a bunch of resource files and scripts. For information on different ways to generate an actual build of the Angular project (and view it on localhost if you want), [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47150724/what-is-difference-between-ng-build-and-ng-serve).

If you're trying to figure out what all those folders are for... welcome to the club. [This might help](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure). *Maybe.*

This is also very helpful:

## *Auto-generated by Angular (mostly)*:

The part of this project under the "relativity-radio" subfolder was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
